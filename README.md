# Library-Database-Management
A simple python project linked with MySQL to perform basic operations in a library management system that you commonly find around. I made this project using tkinter module of python programming language. This project includes basic functionalities which includes:
1) Adding new books to the database
2) Issuing books to the user
3) Deleting a book from the database
4) Returning a book back to the library and storing it back to the system
5) The last functionality is to view the book and all its details.
